I spent my time today doing research on other Lorem Ipsum generator sites. I want to know the basic elements of other sites, so that what I'm building is in line with best practice.

This process exposes another area where I acknowledge a weakness. 

I *hate* blank pieces of paper to start off a new project. I'm creative, but not in the "chisel a block of marble to reveal the statue" inside manner. My creativity tends to flow from the creation and inspiration of others.

There's a theme going around in the development community where frontend web developers are growing tired of their craft. They feel that the web is now a series of pages with:

<iframe src="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/jumbotron/" style="width: 100% ; height: 520px ; overflow: hidden"></iframe>

**Over and over and over again.**

The polished look of a site that follows these conventions is easy to understand...but could be...boring.

<h2>Defense of the "Boring" Layout</h2>
<p>The web is about information. The one thing that I consistently use from my Communications degree: in information transfer, noise is bad. Using a standardized layout, one that many other sites use, allows for the user to have a familiar process to understand and discern information.  In short, simple understandable layouts can decrease noise (or in this case "cognitive load") of the viewer.</p>

<p>If the internet is primarily about information, reducing the amount of mental work is a good thing. But, I know that I'm also tending to learn how to gloss over information much faster in search of what I want. So, does a design convention like the one above actually encourage people to skim?</p>

<h2>loremipsum.io - Not your "Standard" Layout</h2>
In my research, the first site I visted was <a href="https://loremipsum.io" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">loremipsum.io</a>. (Yes, they have ads...a devs gotta eat too)

<iframe src="https://loremipsum.io" style="width: 100% ; height: 520px ; overflow: hidden"></iframe>

They broke the Bootstrap mold when they built this site. It's a modern looking web experience that immediately presents you with a description of what "Lorem Ipsum" text is. Scroll to next item down, the generator (probably why you're here), get what you need and go on.

But if you keep scrolling, the authors of the page give a history of the Lorem Ipsum text. It's often quoted that Lorem Ipsum is meaningless Latin-looking text, but isn't really Latin. The classics minor in me recoils at that thought. As the loremipsum.io people say, "As Cicero would put it, 'Um, not so fast.'‚Äù

This kind of site is intriguing for its design. It informs people that they are at the right site, gives them what they were most likely there to get (the generator text), and then offers information for the curious mind.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Most of the sites that I've worked on fall somewhere in the "standard" spectrum. When I originally set out to build the Aggie Ipsum generator, I found myself initially running to the familiar.</p>

<p>Generating something "new" is work, and frequently the expedient is preferred over the elegant. Because this 100 Days of Code challenge is about stretching into areas previously unknown or poorly known, I am committed to that same concept in the creativity that I bring to this project.</p>

See you tomorrow.
