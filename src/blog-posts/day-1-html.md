The first time I learned any form of code, it was HTML.

When I was eleven, I remember my Boy Scout troop had a night that we all got our merit badge for Computing at the local Gateway store.  Every one showed up one evening, and we all filed into a room that looked like a computer lab at many schools today.  We all sat down and learned the basics of HTML: how tags worked, how hexadecimal colors worked, etc. It was all so new and exciting to finally learn a bit about how to make the computer create something from code that I typed in. At the end of the evening, we all got to take home our first web page on a 3.5" floppy disk.

I didn't grow up in the golden age of home computers with BASIC and an 8-bit computer, so HTML was my beginning into coding.  This foundation was built on by my high school computing class, but admittedly that was more about using Flash elements and "fancy" GIF texts than really building a solid web page in HTML.

This section of the 100 Days of Code suggests that I timeblock HTML to last from days 1-8. Today is nostalgic, and really...really...basic. If it wasn't for the fond memories of typing these elementary < html > tags on a computer that had cow print on it twenty years ago, I'd probably be groaning more.

Today I Learned: Ok, I said this was a remedial course that would expose the little things I glossed over or never learned. It's going to be hard to find that in HTML for now, but I'll keep you up-to-date
