I work in the eLearning sector. My first job was with a research software company in Bellingham, WA. I edited videos professors who visited our studio recorded. I added "on-screen text" and graphics to help emphasize the speaker's main points and improve viewer retention.

My subsequent jobs in eLearning were mostly the same: video of a talking head, augment the video with some other form of reinforcing media, rinse, repeat. 

Each project was a bit different, but ultimately the nagging question through all of the video learning was "why are we doing this?"  More importantly, "how will people know that they've really learned something?"

My latest venture with <a href="https://intelligent.education" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">Intelligent Education</a> seeks to serve this need through micro-quizzes related to the video lessons. The backbone of the information is still video, but we've added interactive 3D models where applicable to help the history come to life, the science to be tangible, and the arts to be appreciated.  At its core though, I still haven't built what I'm looking for (yet...it's coming out soon).

How does an online institution, of any type or scale, allow for their learners to track their progress, encourage projects that are academically honest, and keep a record of their work?

Enter **<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">freeCodeCamp</a>**

```
var point1 = the program that I am working through in the 100 Days of Code challenge;

var point2 = a non-profit online coding school to start coding for yourself;

var point3 = a quasi-academic institution that certifies your work, 
	checks for  plagarism, and issues a certificate of completion;

var freeCodeCamp = point1 + point2 + point3;
```


Their profile system is exactly what I want to see in an online code eLearning platform. Your profile allows you to see and publicly share your progress. You can follow along with my progress <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/blanghoff#cal-heatmap-container" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">here</a>. 

Students should always be able to show off their work, so freeCodeCamp encourages you to add external projects to your <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/blanghoff" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">Portfolio</a>.

But most amazing of all is the project submission system that you are required to do in order to obtain their certificates. Each certificate has a series of structured projects that you must code and submit. *You* must code them, and to enforce their view of academic honesty you must <button style="background-color:#44c767; -moz-border-radius:28px;	-webkit-border-radius:28px;	border-radius:28px;	border:1px solid #18ab29;	display:inline-block; cursor:pointer; color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial; font-size:10px;	padding:4px 6px; text-decoration:none; text-shadow:0px 1px 0px #2f6627;">
I Agree</button> to a straightforward honesty policy that you will not plagarize your code. There is an automated checker that scans through your projects and ensures that you are not merely copying off the web or another freeCodeCamper.  That's **really** cool.

Admittedly, I have yet to submit a project to the academic scrutiny of the automated checker, but already I am excited to see this tool in action when the time comes.

Speaking of time, I published my *entire* <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/blanghoff" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">freeCodeCamp profile</a> as public...so you'll know that I am on-time and on-target for my goal.
