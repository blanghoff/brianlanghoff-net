Today was another day of remedial work in HTML. Unlike yesterday, I feel I learned (or re-learned) something helpful.

HTML Forms, while simple and elementary, never really stuck when I learned the first time. I understood the principle of taking in information, but how the individual elements themselves could be used was not a part of my thinking. Today, as I was going through all the elements that can be used to build a form, it clicked. Simple HTML form elements could be styled with CSS to create robust and beautiful ways to return information back from a website.

While this is a menial thing for many...it finally clicked for me. Hopefully this 100 Days challenge does not consistently point out the obvious to me, because I feel obligated to share my minor revelations at this point. (looking forward to areas where I acknowledge I am weaker).
