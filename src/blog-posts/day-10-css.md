CSS Hierarchy was something you may miss when you're learning CSS by doing.  I certainly did.

When you're poking around other people's code, you miss the nuances of 'id before class, except after inline'.  

**CSS Hierarchy
1. !Important
2. Inline Style
3. ID tag
4. Class tag
5. HTML tag

Another thing that I missed was CSS Variables. While this information is helpful, I had to Google why you would care to use it.

Thankfully, Google itself has an ![answer](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/css-variables-why-should-you-care). After reading the first few lines, it hit me. Is this what controls "dark mode" on so many sites? 

I **love** dark mode for sites. Most of the time, I prefer designing a site to be "dark" from its origins, but on long-standing sites and for accessibility reasons, I understand the need to present multiple options.

This is a useful bit to know. I'll incorporate a "dark mode" switch into the Aggie Ipsum project, just for learning more about CSS Variables.
