Today is the first day of CSS.

I don't know what happened when I was first learning web development, but I pretty much missed learning the foundations of CSS. My understanding of how it works, why it's important, and the practice of using it has always been caught not taught.

This remedial challenge will fix that. Most of what I'm realizing I didn't catch very well is the syntax of CSS.

It's very rudimentary...but I never really understood what a class really was. I used them, I coded them...but I never stopped to understand them.

CSS IDs are much the same. Because I didn't really understand class...I didn't grasp the concept of ID either. I knew it was a way to have a unique address for an element, but beyond that I didn't pay much attention to them.

I'm enjoying moving into CSS, as it will give me the tools to keep building the project for this 100 Days of Code challenge.  I'm going to post the really rudimentary Aggie Ipsum project later this week.  Stay tuned.
