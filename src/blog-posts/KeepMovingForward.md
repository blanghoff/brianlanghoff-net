In the past few weeks (almost a month), I had many other things take precedence above my commitment here. Work got busy (which is good), life got a bit tougher (it always will), and my focus shifted.

But I am coming back to the project, shifting the timeline, resetting the clock and moving forward. One of my favorite quotes from Walt Disney:

>Around here, however, we don't look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious...and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths. -Walt Disney

I'll post more tomorrow...next time on CSS
