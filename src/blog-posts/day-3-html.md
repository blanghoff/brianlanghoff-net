I am finished with the HTML portion of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/blanghoff" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">freeCodeCamp</a>.

While this part of the 100 Days of Code is supposed to last 8 days, I think the intent is that you spend some days doing the exercises (as long as it may take you), and the balance remaining hand coding a project.

I struggled to find an idea that *I* wanted to code. One suggestion is a personal website, or portfolio. This website is functioning mostly like I want it to. It was a Gatsby template that I customized, but it's allowing for me to easily and readily publish.

So I set off to just type `<html>` and set the page's basic elements up, and see where it led. I got to the first `<p>` tag and thought about grabbing some Ipsum text to fill the `<p>` tag...and it hit me.

I don't wear it on my sleeve, but I am a proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2010! At <a href="https://tamu.edu" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">Texas A&M University</a>, there are loads of <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/traditions/" style="color:#1BC6B4; text-decoration:none">traditions</a>, and most of all jargon. Aggie jargon is part of what makes going to Texas A&M so fun. The traditions of the school reflect the storied and diverse history of the students of years past.  But, coming back to the epiphany, Aggies have loads of jargon that other Aggies appreciate. It's part of the glue that binds us together.

I've searched (rather cursorily) in Google, and I didn't find an Ipsum Generator devoted to my beloved Texas A&M. My project for this 100 Days of Code will be to develop, from scratch and by my own hands, a Fightin' Texas Aggie Ipsum Generator.

Stay tuned for the first static iteration to be linked here.
