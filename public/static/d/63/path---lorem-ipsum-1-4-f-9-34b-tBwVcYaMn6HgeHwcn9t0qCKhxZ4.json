Frequently, the anonymity that the internet affords allows for the unbridled truth to flow from the rawness of an individual's soul.</p>\n<p>This is not that kind of confession.</p>\n<p>I've worked professionally in the technology sector now for almost 7 years.

These sources are great for those learning, but there is a deceitfulness in my own use of them. I find myself thinking that I understand, when I perhaps do not possess a full understanding of the basics.</p>\n<p>Resolved:\nIn 100 Days, I will resolve this lack of understanding, at least for the frontend side of code.</p>\n<p>I came across a post on Reddit, sharing the <a href=\"https://github.com/nas5w/100-days-of-code-frontend\">100DaysofCode</a> project. This \"somewhat opinionated curriculum\" provides a path for \"couch to code\". Perhaps some items will be tediously remedial, my goal in working through this curriculum is to increase the foundational understanding of each component in frontend development.</p>\n<p>I'm starting today, working six days a week (skipping Sundays). I'll post here each day with minor comments on what I've learned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Remedium: 100 Days of Code","date":"16 March, 2019","tags":["100DaysOfCode","Remedium"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lorem-ipsum-1/"}}
