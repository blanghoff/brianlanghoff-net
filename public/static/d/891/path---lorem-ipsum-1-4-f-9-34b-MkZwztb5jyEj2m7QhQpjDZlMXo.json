{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Confessions are fairly popular to yell into the void of the internet.  Frequently, the anonymity that the internet affords allows for the unbridled truth to flow from the rawness of an individual's soul.</p>\n<p>This is not that kind of confession. I'm posting this on my own site.</p>\n<p>I've worked professionally in the technology sector now for almost 7 years. While I am skilled in my own right with a knack for understanding, aggregating, and developing new ideas and perspectives to move projects and initiatives forward, I am woefully behind on the basics.</p>\n<p>I find myself too dependent on message boards, templates*, and third-party sources to get what I want done. These sources are great for those learning, but there is a deceitfulness in my own use of them. I find myself thinking that I understand, when I perhaps do not possess a full understanding of the basics. </p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<strong>Resolved</strong>\n\t<br />\n\tIn 100 Days, I will resolve this lack of understanding, at least for the frontend side of code.\n</blockquote>\n<p>I came across a post on Reddit, sharing the <a href=\"https://github.com/nas5w/100-days-of-code-frontend\">100DaysofCode</a> project. This \"somewhat opinionated curriculum\" provides a path for \"couch to code\". Perhaps some items will be tediously remedial, my goal in working through this curriculum is to increase the foundational understanding of each component in frontend development.</p>\n<p>I'm starting today, working six days a week (skipping Sundays). This completes the 100 Day challenge on July 24.* I'll post here each day with minor comments on what I've learned.</p>\n<p>*This site is a derivative of VimalRaj Selvam's work <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/email2vimalraj/gatsby-starter-tech-blog/\">here</a>\n<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm taking almost two weeks off during the end of May</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Remedium: 100 Days of Code","date":"16 March, 2019","tags":["100DaysOfCode","Remedium"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lorem-ipsum-1/"}}
